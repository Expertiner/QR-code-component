- CSS custom properties
- ~~Flexbox~~
- CSS Grid
<!--

-->

### What I learned

- How to take a screenshot of the page on Chrome
  > `cmd + opt + I` > `cmd + shift + P` > `Screenshot`

- File paths.
  > `./`      current directory
  >
  > `../`     one level up directory
  >
  > `../../`  two levels up directory
  
- Strikethrough text on .md
  > Surround the text with two tildes (~)

### Continued development

- Concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with:
  - CSS grid
  - Github repo
  - The HTML attributes `name=""` and `content=""`
  - How to tab on .md
  - How to comment on .md
  - How to show hidden folders on VS Code

- Techniques I want to refine and perfect:
  - The CSS property `margin`

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This helped me throughout my solution.

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - This helped me at writing my first text in .md.

- [Git Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) - This helped me at understanding the basics of git. The best git tutorial that i could find.

- [Change Directories on Mac Terminal](https://www.easeus.com/computer-instruction/change-directory-in-terminal-mac.html#:~:text=To%20change%20the%20directory%20in%20Terminal%20Mac%2C%20it%27s%20recommended%20to,desktop%20into%20the%20Terminal%20Mac.) - This helped me at learning basic stuff about navigating through Mac Terminal.

- [Showing Hidden Folders on Finder](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-access-your-macs-hidden-files#:~:text=View%20Hidden%20Files%20in%20Finder&text=In%20Finder%2C%20click%20your%20hard,make%20the%20hidden%20files%20appear.) - This taught me an easy keyboard shortcut to unhide hidden folders on Finder.
